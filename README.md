# Z-sender
Secure File transfer utility over the internet using AES-GCM encryption

What it Does?
The sender can specify a file to be transfered. The program outputs a random string that the reciever will enter into the program to start the transfer of the files. 
The users can pre-authenticate each other for future communications, in this case a authentication key is generated and the sender is added to the receiver's contacts. 
All future communications are verified to belong to the contact list if not, then a prompt is shown that say's file from an unknown sender. 

(Project is still in production and testing)
